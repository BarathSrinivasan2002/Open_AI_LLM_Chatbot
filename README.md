Chatbot used to train Premed student with realtime AI patients. Utilizes speech to text and text to speech to simulate real world scenarios. Uses Retrieval Augumented Generation architecture to increase the model's capabilities. Mimics realtime patients by utilising profile engineering techniques.

Project: Virtual Interview Platform Development

Simulated Virtual Clinic Environment: Designed an interactive system where virtual patients engaged with doctors through advanced conversational AI, enabling real-time diagnoses and treatments.
Dynamic AI Patient Profiles: Created diverse virtual patient behaviors (e.g., children, elderly, etc.) for realistic doctor-patient interactions, leveraging reasoning and context-specific understanding.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Implemented tools like embeddings and Pinecone for real-time integration of external data (e.g., patient records, medical knowledge), enhancing decision-making accuracy.
Speech and Audio Capabilities: Integrated text-to-speech (TTS) and automatic speech recognition (ASR) for seamless voice interactions.
Multi-Agent System: Designed collaborative multi-agent frameworks where AI models represented family members for complex, multi-party consultations.
Evaluation Metrics: Ensured project success by focusing on task completion, prompt quality, cost efficiency, and innovative bonus features.
